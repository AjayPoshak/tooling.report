Browserify is designed to write javascript useing `require` for browser code. It does not support ES2015 import/export out of the box.

It is discussed on this open issue [Add support for ES6 import syntax](https://github.com/browserify/browserify/issues/1186), currently need to employ Babel to proceed.

TODO: show Babelify option as example of what to do with old codebase?
